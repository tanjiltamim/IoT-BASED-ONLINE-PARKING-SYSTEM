• Developed an IoT based online parking system which will help the user to find a nearby parking space and it will reduce road side parking as a result reduce traffic jam.

• User can search for nearby parking space and see the live slot occupancy status.

• Used Arduino, Ultrasonic-Sensor, Ethernet Shield for parking slot live occupancy status.

• Successfully able to fetch the data from sensor and send it to database over the internet.

• Technology used for front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

• Technology used for back-end: PHP, MySQL.
